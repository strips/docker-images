## Introduction

This project offers Dockerfiles and scripts to build and configure an Oracle Internet Directory (OID) image based on the 12cPS4 (12.2.1.4.0) release.

Use this image to facilitate installation, configuration, and environment setup for DevOps users.

This image includes binaries for OID Release 12.2.1.4.0 and it has the capability to create a Fusion Middleware (FMW) Infrastructure domain and OID specific servers.

## Building the Oracle Internet Directory image

An Oracle Internet Directory image can be created and/or made available for deployment in the following ways:

1. Oracle's preferred and recommended approach is to use the WebLogic Image Tool to build the Oracle Internet Directory 12.2.1.4.0 image along with the latest Bundle Patch and any additional patches that you require. For more information, see [Building an Oracle Internet Directory image with WebLogic Image Tool](imagetool/12.2.1.4.0)
1. Build or customize your own Oracle Internet Directory image using the `Dockerfile` and build scripts provided by Oracle. For more information, see [Building an Oracle Internet Directory Image](dockerfiles/12.2.1.4.0/README.md).

## Oracle Internet Directory Container Configuration

To deploy the Oracle Internet Directory container as a standalone container, see the [Creating an Oracle Internet Directory container](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/idm/internet-directory/12.2.1.4/tutorial-oid-docker/) tutorial.

## Deploying Oracle Internet Directory on Kubernetes

To deploy Oracle Internet Directory to a Kubernetes cluster, see the [Oracle Internet Directory on Kubernetes](https://oracle.github.io/fmw-kubernetes/oid/) documentation.
